    <p>
      Originally from Ohio and former resident of New York City, NY and Santa Monica, CA.  
      Currently residing in Charleston, WV with a symmetrical gigabit internet connection and amazing views.  In my free 
        time I can be found spending time with my family and enjoying time in the outdoors.  Either on foot, a mountinabike, a snowboard 
        and occasionally an electric skateboard.  But, usually I am just <a href="https://zerathedog.com" target="_blank">walking the dog</a>.

      <h2>Sample Projects</h2>
      <p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-eks-demo/tree/main" target="_blank"> AWS EKS Cluster Deployment with Terraform</a></h3>
        This project demonstrates the deployment of an AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using a combination of Terraform, 
        official Terraform modules, custom-built modules, and Terraform Workspaces. The central concept is to use a 
        <a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-eks-demo/blob/main/environments.tf" target="_blank">single configuration file</a> 
        to manage multiple environments seamlessly. By leveraging a CI/CD pipeline, builds are triggered based on environment-specific tags, 
        ensuring a clean and consistent codebase across all environments. This approach allows for streamlined iterations, enabling easy 
        tracking and deployment of changes across instances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kubernetes cluster is fully configured with access rights, logging, and ingress routing using Traefik. This is achieved through Terraform and Helm 
        charts where applicable. Applications are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster based on the centralized <a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-eks-demo/blob/main/applications.tf" target="_blank">configuration file</a>, 
        ensuring consistency across environments.
      </p>
      <p>Upon completion of the build process, the result is a fully functional, web-accessible Kubernetes cluster that is ready for application deployments. This setup highlights efficiency, scalability, and best practices 
        in managing Kubernetes workloads on AWS.</p>
      <p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-ecs-demo/tree/main" target="_blank"> AWS ECS Cluster Deployment with Terraform</a></h3>
        Similar to the EKS code above; This project demonstrates the deployment of a complete infrastructure stack for Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) Fargate using Terraform. By utilizing a combination of official Terraform modules and custom-built modules, the process includes provisioning an ECS cluster with fully configured access rights, logging, and an ingress controller powered by Traefik.
        The deployment approach emphasizes modularity and best practices, enabling efficient management of resources while maintaining a clean and organized codebase. This setup ensures that the ECS infrastructure is robust and ready to support containerized applications, providing a scalable and reliable platform for modern workloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-ec2-asg-module" target="_blank"> AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group Terraform Module</a></h3>
        This Terraform module is designed to seamlessly deploy a new AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG) into an existing infrastructure. It integrates with SaltStack configuration files, ensuring consistent setup for hosted websites, 
        including SSL certificates, Launch Templates, and Load Balancer routing rules. By leveraging Terraform's capability to read and adapt to existing infrastructure, this module 
        provides an efficient and reliable way to extend the existing cloud environment.
