      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-eks-demo/tree/main" target="_blank"> AWS EKS</a></h3>
        Using Terraform, Official Terraform Modules, custom built modules and Terraform Workspaces to deploy and AWS EKS Cluster.
          The main idea was to use a <a href="https://github.com/jamesbernardi/aws-eks-demo/blob/main/environments.tf" target="_blank"> central configuration file</a> to deploy multiple environments.  Using the CI/CD pipeline to trigger builds 
          based on environment tags. Keeping a clean code base across all environments and allowing iterations to be easily tracked and 
          deployed across environments.
